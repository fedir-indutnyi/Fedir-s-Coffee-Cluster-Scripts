this might make machine unbootable

Some people may need to run wsl update:

wsl --update
To enable, start your Ubuntu (or other Systemd) distribution under WSL (typically just wsl ~ will work).

sudo -e /etc/wsl.conf
Add the following:

[boot]
systemd=true
Exit Ubuntu and again:

wsl --shutdown
Then restart Ubuntu.

sudo systemctl status
